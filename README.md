# About
Game for Ludum Dare 55 game jam, created within 72 hours. The game jam's theme was summoning. This project was solo-made. I crafted all the code, except the template, and designed all graphics except for the fonts. Attribution for used assets can be found [here](credits/CREDITS.md).

# Game
In Path of Summoner, you take the role of a summoner tasked with saving the world from dangerous monsters. Within your dungeon, you possess a summoning circle, where you can combine ingredients to summon minions. These summoned creatures will aid you in combat. However, if they all dies, monsters will get you.
